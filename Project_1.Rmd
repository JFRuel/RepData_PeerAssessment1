```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```


```{r, results='asis'}
library(xtable)
activities <- tbl_df(read.csv("activity.csv"))
xt <- xtable(summarise(group_by(filter(activities,steps != "NA"),date),sum(steps), median(steps), mean(steps)))
print(xt, type = "html")
```



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
